**Note: To run the project**

Any setup or os that golang is installed required to run the scripts.

The questions are separated into two different folders:

**signal_strength:**
Look at  <https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10> to know the type and correct format of the input required to run the program. From this project root folder cd into signal_strength `cd signal_strength` and run `go run main.go` then enter the right input required. One time copy and paste works fine, all thanks to `bufio.NewScanner`

**surface_area:**
Look at  <https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/18> to know the type and correct format of the input required to run the program. From this project root folder cd into surface_area `cd surface_area` and run `go run main.go` then enter the right input required. One time copy and paste works fine, all thanks to `bufio.NewScanner`

Thanks for you time.
